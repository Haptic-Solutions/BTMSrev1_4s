Fix: Charging routine not fully charging the battery and then maintaining the voltage. Testing.

Implement: MPPT for solar charging.

Implement: I2C communication to USB3.1 PD chip. Mostly done. Bug where re-plugging in the charger does not initiate USB3 charging. Testing. Seems to work alright after changing some things. Keep an eye on this.

Implement: Power button features. Done.

Implement: Better CLI interface such as more info available at request, and easier to understand variable names. Partly Done. Need to implement HUD config system.

Implement: Be able to change ALL settings from CLI. Mostly Done.

Fix: Fault light doesn't always turn on when an error is logged, especially when system shuts down, and doesn't always blink as it should.

Fix: Settings checksum doesn't seem to always update or gets corrupted. System recovers, but generates an error code anyways. Done. Fixed.
