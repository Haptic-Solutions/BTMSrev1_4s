Add: Small electrolytic decoupling capacitors to output of buck-boost converter. Might need some on input as well. Seems to trip USB-PD charges when average current isn't anywhere near it's set limit.

Upgrade: Current output rating is only 10 amps. Try to get it up to 15 amps. Not high priority.

Fix: Lots of EMI coming from multiplexed LED drive circuit. <- Moved resistors as close to dsPIC as possible. Added resistor to multiplex selector.

Fix: USB and AUX charge inputs will output power to one or the other. This is NOT safe for either device that may be plugged in. <- Added diode to USB input. Need better solution that doesn't waste so much energy as heat.

Fix: Capacitive loads cause inrush current that trips the over current protection circuit. A pre-charge circuit with resistors might work with some types of loads, but probably not when loads are both resistive and capacitive. <- Changed power source of
current sense IC's to an IO pin of the micro controller so that they can be reset when a known inrush current is about to be switched on.
