Fault Codes for battery controller. When SD proceeds error code, the system has been shutdown to prevent damage or fire as well as a 0x0B (Fault Shutdown Event) error code.

0x01	Heater is too small for the watts you want.

0x02	No heater detected.

0x03	Short circuit on heater, or heater load too large.

0x04	Low battery shutdown event. SD.

0x05	Discharge over current. SD.

0x06	Charge over current. SD.

0x07	High battery voltage shutdown event. SD.

0x08	Battery Over Temp. SD.

0x09	Motor controller over temp. SD.

0x0A	Abominable Snow Monster over temp. SD.

0x0B	Fault shutdown event.

0x0C	TRAP: PWM Fault Event. SD.

0x0D	TRAP: Oscillator Fail Event. 

0x0E	TRAP: Address Error Event. SD.

0x0F	TRAP: Stack Error Event. SD.

0x10	TRAP: Math Error Event. SD.

0x11	TRAP: Reserved Trap 7 Event. SD.

0x12	TRAP: PLL out of lock. Also causes an Osc Fail Event. Can be caused by elecrical noise or bad power supply section. System can usually recover from these as long as they aren't too severe or frequent.

0x18	CPU: Instruction Reset Event. SD.

0x19	CPU: Reset. SD.

0x1A	Invalid serial port. User error or bad code.

0x1B	Insufficient current from charger. SD.

0x1C	Partial charge voltage was set higher than 100%. User error or bad code.

0x1D	VHigh on Battery voltage input. SD.

0x1E	VLow on Battery voltage input. SD.

0x1F	VHigh on Battery current input. SD.

0x20	VLow on Battery current input. SD.

0x21	VHigh on Battery temp input. SD.

0x22	VLow on Battery temp input. SD.

0x23	VHigh on motor control temp input. SD.

0x24	VLow on motor control temp input. SD.

0x25	VHigh on snowman's temp input. SD.
