Fault Codes for battery controller. When SD proceeds error code, the system has been shutdown to prevent damage or fire. A 0x0B (Fault Shutdown Event) error code will also be logged in this scenario.

0x01	Heater is too small for the watts you want.

0x02	No heater detected.

0x03	Short circuit on heater, or heater load too large.

0x04	Low battery shutdown event. SD.

0x05	Discharge over current. SD.

0x06	Charge over current. SD.

0x07	High battery voltage shutdown event. SD.

0x08	Battery Over Temp. SD.

0x09	Motor controller over temp. SD.

0x0A	Abominable Snow Monster over temp. SD.

0x0B	Fault shutdown event.

0x0C	TRAP: PWM Fault Event. SD.

0x0D	TRAP: Oscillator Fail Event. (This may not always cause system wide errors, so for now I have disabled the shutdown function when this error occures for debugging purposes)

0x0E	TRAP: Address Error Event. SD.

0x0F	TRAP: Stack Error Event. SD.

0x10	TRAP: Math Error Event. SD.

0x11	TRAP: Reserved Trap 7 Event. SD.

0x12	TRAP: PLL out of lock. Also causes an Osc Fail Event. Can be caused by elecrical noise or failing power supply section. System can usually recover from these as long as they aren't too severe or frequent.

0x13	CPU: Brown Out Event. SD.

0x14	CPU: WDT Reset Event. SD.

0x15	CPU: TRAP Conflict Event. SD.

0x16	CPU: Illegal opcode or uninitialized W register access Event. SD.

0x17	CPU: External Reset Event. SD.

0x18	CPU: Instruction Reset Event. SD.

0x19	CPU: Reset. SD.

0x1A	Invalid serial port. User error or bad code.

0x1B	Insufficient current from charger. Is the battery voltage detection calibrated? SD.

0x1C	Partial charge voltage was set higher than 100%. User error or bad code.

0x1D	Voltage High on Battery voltage input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x1E	Voltage Low on Battery voltage input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x1F	Voltage High on Battery current input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x20	Voltage Low on Battery current input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x21	Voltage High on Battery temp input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x22	Voltage Low on Battery temp input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x23	Voltage High on motor control temp input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x24	Voltage Low on motor control temp input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x25	Voltage High on snowman's temp input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x26	Voltage Low on snowman's temp input pin of dsPIC. SD.

0x27	Spare error code.

0x28	Spare error code.
