Command Set and basic usage.

After each return signal received an "a" for acknowledge will be sent. If
there is faults logged in the fault code handler the "a" will
be followed by "!"

# - Resets the microcontroller.

H - Enables auto heater calibration check and Manually runs heater calibration.

h - Disable heater calibration and check.

E - Local echo on or off using "y" or "n" as args. (default 'y')

R - Reads analog inputs 100 times and prints them. (warning, this currently causes charge/discharge regulator services to hang) --fixme, probably just need to remove this command.

r - Reads analog inputs only one time. (warning, this currently causes charge/discharge regulator services to hang for a moment)

S - Low power shutdown test. Can only be waken back up through pluggin in the charger or resetting through the command set.

F - Read fault codes.

C - Clears fault codes and errors.

M - Toggles Battery safety monitor. On by default.

P - Toggles main power output. A software power switch. -- Need to use p and P for off and on instead of it being a toggle.

Z - Overide partial charge and set to fully charge battery one time.

V - Shows Voltage Percentage

B - Read battery's calculated current capacity.

O - Use POS display for HUD (default)

o - Disable POS display for HUD

u - increase v_test (I forget what this does) -- this is a debug command. It increases the PWM duty cycle for the main output by one tick.
