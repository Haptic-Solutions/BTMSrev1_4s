Command Set and basic usage.

After each return signal received an "@" for acknowledge will be sent. If
there is faults logged in the fault code handler the "@" will
be followed by "!"

Commands listed with a 'U' are commands that don't get locked when settings are locked. Settings with 'L' get locked. Settings with 'UL' will have their function modified when settings are locked.

Command:

l =U= Unlock system settings: USAGE: 'l Y'
L =L= Lock system settings and begin all system safety checks
# =L= Reset the CPU
~ =L= Reset battery meters and variables, and reset settings to default values
! =L= Reset battery meters and variables, and reset CPU
& =L= Set system runlevel from critical-error to heartbeat
Q =L= Run calibration routine: USAGE: 'Q n vv.vv' where n is the input number 1-5: 1-4 are the cell inputs and 5 is charge input voltage, and 'vv.vv' are the ABSOLUTE voltages in reference to ground
$ =U= Generate program flash checksum and compare it to what is stored
% =U= Generate NVM checksum and compare it to what is stored
b =U= List USB PD options
V =U= Set USB PD to highest wattage
v =U= Set USB PD to lowest voltage
F =U= Read fault codes and system safety flags
C =UL= Clear faultcodes and reset safety flags if settings are not locked
H =U= Enable heater system and perform a test
h =U= disable heater system and do not test on startup
S =U= Go into deep-sleep mode
P =U= Output power on
p =U= Output power off
O =U= LCD HUD on for this port
o =U= LCD HUD off for this port
t =U= list time left until next deep-sleep <- useless because sending any characters resets the timer.
Z =U= Commit to a full charge regardless of partial-charge settings
* =U= Print firmware version
a =U= Abort automatic battery evaluation
A =U= Start automatic battery evaluation
i ==U Print system telemetry: USAGE: 'i nn q' presence of 'q' in this command prints only the numerical value of selected variable. Omitting all command arguments lists ALL info
e =U= Print system settings: USAGE: 'e nn q' presence of 'q' in this command prints only the numerical value of selected variable. Omitting all command arguments lists ALL info
E =UL= Edit system settings: USAGE: 'E nn xx.xx q' presence of 'q' in this command prints only the numerical value of selected variable. Omitting all command arguments lists ALL info
+ =U= Echo ON
= =U= Echo OFF
