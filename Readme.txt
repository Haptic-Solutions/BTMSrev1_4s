Small battery pack power management system derived from -> Battery Charge/Discharge and
Heater Controller for small electric vehicles.

This system provides Battery telemetry services such as Voltage, Current, and Temperature. 

It also regulates charge/discharge voltages, limits current when battery temps are too
high or too low, controls a battery heater for cold environments.
Works with lithium ion batteries from 2S to 4S.
It also does basic error logging and will shut down the system on events such as
under/over voltage, over current, temps out of range, internal CPU errors, etc. with
room to expand.

As of Feb 12th, 2024. -->This system is currently in development and not ready to use.<--
